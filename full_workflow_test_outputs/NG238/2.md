# Cohort: Secondary Prevention of CVD
Individuals with established cardiovascular disease receiving interventions to prevent further cardiovascular events.

## 1. Individuals with Established CVD on Lipid-Lowering Treatment
Adults with established CVD who are currently receiving lipid-lowering treatment.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("Adults with established CVD") OR ("On lipid-lowering treatment")

### Reference Sentences
- We reviewed the evidence and made a new recommendation on the target lipid level for secondary prevention of CVD for adults on lipid-lowering treatment.

## 2. Individuals with Acute Coronary Syndromes
Individuals presenting with acute coronary syndromes requiring lipid profile assessment and potential statin initiation.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("Adults with acute coronary syndromes")

### Reference Sentences
- The recommendation on acute coronary syndromes was amended to clarify that a full lipid profile is needed on admission to hospital and 2 to 3 months after starting treatment.

## 3. Individuals with Established CVD Not Reaching Lipid Target on Statins
Individuals with established CVD who are currently on statin therapy but have not achieved the target LDL cholesterol level of 2.0 mmol/L or non-HDL cholesterol level of 2.6 mmol/L.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("Adults with established CVD") OR ("On statins") OR ("LDL cholesterol >= 2.0 mmol/L OR Non-HDL cholesterol >= 2.6 mmol/L")

### Reference Sentences
- Escalation of treatment was cost effective for people on statins with LDL cholesterol levels of more than 2.2 mmol per litre.
- Using the distribution of LDL cholesterol levels for the population with CVD and on a statin in the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) dataset, 42% of people had LDL cholesterol levels of 2.0 mmol per litre or more.
- Using the same data, the threshold for non-HDL cholesterol that would produce an identical number of people being escalated for treatment was 2.6 mmol per litre.

## 4. Individuals with Established CVD Who Cannot Take Statins
Individuals with established CVD who are statin intolerant or for whom statins are contraindicated, requiring alternative lipid-lowering strategies.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("Adults with established CVD") OR ("Statin intolerance OR Statin contraindication")

### Reference Sentences
- The committee did not review the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of lipid-lowering treatments in people who are statin intolerant or for whom statins are contraindicated but based their recommendations on NICE's technology appraisal guidance on alirocumab, bempedoic acid, evolocumab, ezetimibe and inclisiran.
