# Cohort: Individuals on Statin Therapy
Individuals currently prescribed statins for either primary or secondary prevention of CVD.

## 1. Individuals Experiencing Muscle Pain on Statins
Individuals reporting muscle pain while taking statins, requiring assessment to determine if the pain is statin-related.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("On statins") OR ("Reports muscle pain")

### Reference Sentences
- Evidence on the risk of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with statin use demonstrated a real effect, but the large body of evidence showed this was a very small increased risk when compared with similar populations not on statins; that is, when using high-intensity statins approximately 16% of people reported experiencing muscle pain, but of these cases only around 1 in 12 were likely to be due to the statin.

## 2. Individuals Not Reaching Lipid Target on Statins
Individuals on statins who have not achieved their target lipid levels, requiring optimization of treatment.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("On statins") OR ("Not reaching lipid target")

### Reference Sentences
- The committee amended the 2014 consensus recommendation on what to do if someone taking statins does not reach their lipid target to apply to both the existing primary prevention target and the new secondary prevention target.

## 3. Individuals with Increased Blood Glucose or HbA1c on Statins
Individuals on statins who experience an increase in blood glucose or HbA1c levels.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("On statins") OR ("Increased blood glucose OR Increased HbA1c")

### Reference Sentences
- The evidence supported the 2008 and 2014 recommendations on… not stopping statins because of an increase in blood glucose or HbA1c…

## 4. Individuals Stopped Statins Due to Drug Interactions or Illness
Individuals who have temporarily discontinued statin therapy due to drug interactions or illness.

### Inclusion Criteria
- ("Previously on statins") OR ("Stopped statins due to drug interactions OR Stopped statins due to illness")

### Reference Sentences
- The evidence supported the 2008 and 2014 recommendations on… restarting statins if stopped because of drug interactions or illness…
